                      of. These features may need to be enabled if you're having 
                      problems accessing your site via an FTP client. The 
                      following will explain:<br>

                      <br>
                      This can sometimes occur if your accessing the Internet 
                      from behind a firewall, personal router, or using an 
                      Internet connection sharing system such as NAT (Network 
                      Address Translation). This is often a class case scenario 
                      in a home or small office where several computers are 
                      being shared by one Internet connection.&nbsp;&nbsp; Symptoms 
                      include, difficulty logging in via FTP, and or maintaining

                      their browser, but forgetting to create their welcoming 
                      page as index.html, so here's what happens: They access 
                      their site as
                      http://www.mydomain.com/ or using the associated IP 
                      number, for example,
                      http://test.html/, and what they see is their entire 
                      file directory structure! Yikes!… It looks just like 
                      exploring the C drive on your computer! You don't want

                      automatically display the home or welcoming page. It's 
                      because the server automatically looks for index.html 
                      whenever a domain or directory is called without a 
                      filename appended to it such as this,
                      http://www.mydomain.com/file.html<br>
                      <br>
                      If it can't find index.html, it will simply list "your 
                      entire web directory" to everyone that access's it, which 
                      is a MAJOR security risk! ALWAYS, use an "index.html" file 
                      in any directory you create, including your "root" web 
                      directory. In general, it's always a good idea to use "index.html" 
                      as your main page in "all sub-directories" of your 
                      account. Forgetting to place an index.html in your root 
                      web, or any subdirectory of your web for that matter will 
                      effectively leave all of its contents viewable to the 
                      world. <br>

						<font color="#666666">Another small detail, which can 
                      throw many newer users into a tailspin. Unlike your local 
                      PC, the Unix file system is very particular about 
                      "uppercase" and "lowercase" file names. Therefore, if you 
                      were to install a script, (let's say the wwwboard 
                      discussion forum) for example), the name of this script 
                      would be wwwboard.pl.&nbsp; If you name a file picture file 
                      called me.jpg, then this is what you must call it as.&nbsp; 
                      Naming it me.JPG for example, (observe the uppercase) 
                      tells a Unix web server to treat it as a totally different 
                      file name. <br>
                      <br>
                      Unix file servers are exceptionally fussy on this issue, 
                      so make sure you pay close attention to "case' when 
                      uploading files, or installing and configuring cgi based 
                      scripts. The same rule applies for all files including 
                      your .html pages. Again, the server treats .html and .HTML 
                      as two entirely different files. Want to keep in simple? 
                      Try to stick with lowercase letters in all file names and 
                      extensions. <br>

                      For CGI scripts, this mistake has to be the most common 
                      cause of that annoying error known as the (Server 500 
                      Error - Malformed Headers), or something to that lovely 
                      extent. While this can be the result of many various 
                      programming errors, the most popular amongst new users are 
                      uploading their scripts in the "WRONG" format. Your cgi 
                      scripts "MUST" always be uploaded in ASCII mode. 
                      Alternatively, if you upload an image or .exe file, it 
                      must be done in "BINARY" mode. </font> <br>

                      <font color="#666666">In short, html or text based files are supposed to be 
                      transferred in ASCII mode. Uploading them in Binary mode 
                      will append ^M's to the end of every line. In most cases, 
                      this is OK, with html files because your browser will 
                      ignore them. BUT, with other text files such as cgi 
                      scripts, uploading them in binary will damage them, thus 
                      causing a (server 500 error). This is because binary mode 
                      has added ^M's to the end of every line, which are not 
                      supposed to be in the program. This of course, is what 
                      causes the additional message of (Malformed Headers), 
                      which often displays at the bottom of the "Server 500" 
                      message when a CGI script has crashed. <br>
                      <br>
                      Once again, BINARY mode is used for transferring 
                      executable programs, compressed files and all 
                      image/picture files. If you try to upload an image in 
                      ASCII mode, you observer a strange mess appearing on the 
                      page where the image is suppose to appear. ASCII mode in 
                      this case, has corrupted the binary coding in the jpeg or 
                      gif image. If this happens, just re-upload it in the 
                      Binary format <br>

                      everything in binary mode, but when "Automatic" is 
                      selected, the FTP client will check a list of known ASCII

                      Microsoft FrontPage web editor. The two are essentially 
                      the same and provide the same basic purpose. Unless you're 
                      using FrontPage, you will probably use the .html extension 
                      at the end of your web pages. </font> <br>

                      <font color="#666666">Most commonly used because of its good compression in web 
                      page images. Generally, .gif files are the fastest 
                      loading, as they remove a lot of information, which is not 
                      required to maintain image integrity, but to a point 
                      however. .jpg will allow more flexibility in compression 
                      and quality settings, however can also result in larger 
                      files. </font> <br>

                      <font color="#666666">.cgi and .pl are most often used for perl scripts. Perl 
                      scripts are small text based programs, which are executed 
                      on the server end, and will perform a host of interactive 
                      functions for a web site. In short, when a .pl or .cgi 
                      file is called, it tells the server to process it using 
                      the "Perl Interpreter." The Perl Interpreter understands 
                      the programming within the script, and will perform the 
                      set of sub routines, which will yield your desired effect. 
                      This desired effect could be anything from a simple web 
                      page counter, to more complex programs such as discussion 
                      forums, e-commerce platforms, to online auctions. In many 
                      cases, you can download these "ready to go" scripts for 
                      free, and in others you may have to purchase them. <br>

                      rules. &nbsp; As a result, FrontPage does not always conform to 
                      the rules of Unix, so you should be extremely careful when 
                      accessing a FrontPage web via FTP.&nbsp; It's easy to damage 
                      the FrontPage web, as well as it's associated server 
                      extensions, and if it happens, you may loose the ability 
                      to administrate it from your FrontPage Explorer. To avoid

                      <br>
                      If possible, try to create your FrontPage webs in 
                      sub-directories of your root. For example,
                      http://www.yourdomain.com/home. This way, you can 
                      safely FTP into your root account to perform other tasks, 
                      while avoiding the FrontPage webs, which are safely out of 
                      the way in their own separate homes. Remember! DO NOT 
                      delete any folders, which end in _vtf! This will kill your 
                      FrontPage web, and we'll have to reinstall the extensions 
                      for you. <em>For additional information on FrontPage,

              access, while allowing the Group and Public "Read and Execute" 
              permissions. So what are we actually saying? In short, when users 
              access your cgi script, the server has been instructed to grant 
              them permissions to "Read and Execute" it. Sound scary? It's not 
              actually… <br><br 
              >Remember that a script is a program that must 
              be processed by the server. As long as the script is written 
              properly, you can safely allow users to execute it, and thus 
              providing the desired results. For example, if they wanted to post 
              a message to your wwwboard discussion forum, then they would need 
              these permissions to execute wwwboard.pl, which would write their 
              new message to an html file, which is displayed on the main forum. 
              &nbsp; The new message would reside in a directory on your site so 
              other users could view it. <em>Most cgi, perl 
              and other scripts you'll be installing come complete with 
              instructions telling you which permissions you'll need to set them 
              to. <br></em></font><br

              usually with the .shtml extension.&nbsp; The .shtml extension 
              tells the server to do something different with the web page. When 
              you append the .html or .htm extension, this tells the server to 
              "read" the page only. The .shtml extension tells the server to

              want to execute the page? There are various commands you can 
              program into a web page, which the server will look for and parse 
              when the file is called as .shtml. In many cases, this mode is 
              used in conjunction with Server Side Include (SSI) tags, to call a 
              CGI script. For example, you have a visitor counter script, and 
              we'll call it count.cgi. Every time someone visits your website, 
              you want the script to be called, so that it logs the visitor into 
              a file. <br><br><br 
              >To do this, you would place an SSI tag into 
              your web page. The tag in this case, would look something like: 
              <br><br><strong

              the instructions that came with your script carefully. &nbsp; They 
              should provide specific instructions on how to configure the

              overview, we'll try to keep it as general as possible. There are 2 
              basic places DNS records reside:<br><br 
              >International Root name servers (13 exist 
              throughout the world)<br>Your domain 
              register, where your current DNS settings reside.<br 
              ><br><br 
              >When you register/purchase your domain name 
              on a particular "registers name server", your DNS settings are 
              kept on their server, and in most cases point your domain to the 
              Name Server of your hosting provider. This Name Server is where 
              the IP number (currently associated with your domain name) 
              resides. <br><br>The 
              entire hierarchy is somewhat involved, but in short, the world 
              Root Name Servers can be considered the master listing of all DNS 
              records, and there are currently 13 of them in the world. These 
              name servers are where all the master DNS records are kept. The 
              DNS server of your ISP will typically query the Root Name Servers 
              once every 24-hours. This is how they update all of their DNS 
              tables, which in turn, resolve www requests to the IP number of 
              the server they reside on. <br></font><br

              this register is where your current DNS settings reside. That is, 
              unless you transferred your domain name to an alternate register, 
              in which case, you would control your DNS settings from there. <br 
              ><br>The "Register" your 
              domain resides on, communicates your 'current' DNS settings with 
              the International Root name servers, which is turn share this 
              information with ISP's, routers, and cache engines around the 
              world. In essence, it's like a worldwide directory that other 
              computers can refer to when they want to match a domain name with 
              its associate IP number. This IP number is how the particular 
              server your website resides on is located.

              there's more folks. The Internet itself must update/clear its DNS 
              cache as well. When we say the Internet, we mean the numerous 
              intermediate "points of access" you're routed through before 
              reaching your final destination. For the most part, these 
              intermediate points of access consist of "Internet Routers" and 
              "Internet Caching Engines." These too, maintain their own DNS 
              cache, which assists them in routing traffic/resolving URL's to 
              the correct destination IP's. Don't worry though, as Internet 
              routers are usually faster at clearing their DNS cache than ISP's 
              are. </font><br><br><br

              within 'your domain', or to an 'external email' address, (for 
              example to your home ISP email account). There are two types of

              forwarding) will divert all messages to the forwarding address 
              you've selected, and without sending you a copy of the original 
              message. For example,</font> <a class="l" href="mailto:you@yourdomain.com" >you@yourdomain.com</a>
